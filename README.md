Matrix Muncher allows you to quickly perform operations and undo changes on your matrix as needed. It is focused on being both lenient with
your inputs while also letting you make quick, back-to-back modifications on your matrix without wasting your time.

It has the following features:
- Can put your matrix in either row reduced or row-echelon form
- Can invert and transpose your matrix
- Can provide the determinant of the matrix
- Can perform matrix multiplication, addition, and subtraction
- Can perform any of the three elementary row operations on the matrix, one at a time
- Can discard your matrix for a new one, change your entries, and save your matrix on a whim
- Can revert your matrix back to a previously saved state in case you change your mind
- Can also be goofy in some occasions!

Additionally, it is very much fraction and decimal friendly!
